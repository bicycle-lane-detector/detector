This model was trained according to "Transfer Learning U-Net Deep Learning for Lung Ultrasound Segmentation" ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02196 )
Model v3_3 ( https://github.com/dorltcheng/Transfer-Learning-U-Net-Deep-Learning-for-Lung-Ultrasound-Segmentation )
with a learning rate of 5e-6.

The Combined Data Set Model was loaded and straight trained with the new dataset. 

The network is literally torn between roads and cycleways -> try again with higher learning rate
